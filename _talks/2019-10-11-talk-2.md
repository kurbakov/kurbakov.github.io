I gave an introduction talk for students that participated in [Sumo challenge](https://skaner.p.lodz.pl/sumochallenge/), the biggest robotic competition in robotics in Poland.

In the talk I covered basic concepts of ROS, such as node, difference between subscriber and notifier nodes and topics, roslaunch, etc.

The purpose of the talk was to make students familiar with ROS and encorage to use ROS for robotic competition.

Slideas are available on [Github](https://github.com/kurbakov/ROS_presentation/blob/master/presentation.pdf).
