As part of the AI Summer School organized by [University of Amsterdam](https://abs.uva.nl/content/news/2019/09/ai-summer-school-2019.html?cb) and [TomTom](https://www.tomtom.com/company/events/aisummerschool/), I provided a workshop on autonomous driving.

During the workshop we covered hardware, software and architecture of the [Donkey Car](https://www.donkeycar.com/) software. We provided data and also explained how the data colection works and gave students chanse to collect data. 

During the workshop all students (around 25) were splitted into teams and competed in autonomous driving. Students were responsible for one concrete network responsible for turn detection.

The workshop was a summary of the 1 week training of students in AI.
