Autonomous driving puts a lot of challanges in front of developers. One of the challanges is an effective communication mechanism between different components of the car. Let's take a look on the protocol that designed to enable autonomous driving.


## What is SOME/IP

SOME/IP is an automotive/embedded communication protocol which supports remote procedure calls, event notifications and the underlying serialization/wire format.

The SOME/IP was design with the purpose

- Fulfills the hard requirements regarding resource consumption in an embedded world
- Is compatible through as many use-cases and communication partners as possible
- compatible with AUTOSAR at least on the wire-format level; i.e. can communicate with PDUs AUTOSAR can receive and send without modification to the AUTOSAR standard. The mappings within AUTOSAR shall be chosen according to the SOME/IP specification.
- Provides the features required by automotive use-cases
- Is scalable from tiny to large platforms

SOME/IP designed to enable communication between ECUs. SOME/IP supports User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).


## SOME/IP vs. SOME/IP-SD

You should distinguish SOME/IP and SOME/IP service discovery. 

SOME/IP-SD is used to:
- Locate service instances.
- Detect if service instances are running.
- Implement the Publish/Subscribe handling.


SOME/IP is responsible for message and event sending as well as RPC. These two protocols work together, but they are defined by different documents according to the AUTOSAR.


## Key words of the protocol

### [Proxy/Skeleton](https://www.autosar.org/fileadmin/user_upload/standards/adaptive/17-03/AUTOSAR_EXP_ARAComAPI.pdf)

### [Service](https://www.autosar.org/fileadmin/user_upload/standards/foundation/1-0/AUTOSAR_PRS_SOMEIPProtocol.pdf)

A logical combination of zero or more methods, zero or more events, and zero or more fields.

### [Event/Eventgroup](https://www.autosar.org/fileadmin/user_upload/standards/foundation/1-0/AUTOSAR_PRS_SOMEIPProtocol.pdf)

A uni-directional data transmission that is only invoked on changes or cyclically and is sent from the producer of data to the consumers.

A logical grouping of events and notification events of fields inside a service in order to allow subscription

### [Method](https://www.autosar.org/fileadmin/user_upload/standards/foundation/1-0/AUTOSAR_PRS_SOMEIPProtocol.pdf)

A method, procedure, function, or subroutine that is called/invoked.
