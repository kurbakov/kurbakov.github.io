### Paper

[UNSUPERVISED REPRESENTATION LEARNING WITH DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf)

Important: the project does not implement the paper, but uses the paper to answer some questions. Paper is just as a reference for better understanding.


### About

[Generative adversial network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network) is a big trend today and showed as a powerful tool for unsupervised learning. In the project we will implement a simple GAN to generate unexisting portrets.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network):
> A generative adversarial network (GAN) is a class of machine learning frameworks designed by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in 2014. Two neural networks contest with each other in a game (in the form of a zero-sum game, where one agent's gain is another agent's loss). 

We will use [CelebA](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) dataset for training.


### Implementation

For the implementation we will use Python3 and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).


### Environment

We use [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) to run the code and observe the results.


### Code

All code is available on the [Github](https://github.com/kurbakov/new-face-generation)
