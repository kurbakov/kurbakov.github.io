### About

We use convolutional neural network to classify the bread of the dog. 

About the CNN from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network)

> In deep learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN, or ConvNet) is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery. ... They have applications in image and video recognition, recommender systems, image classification, medical image analysis, natural language processing, brain-computer interfaces, and financial time series.

In this project was not used any paper, I used provided face classifier and pre-trained network [VGG-16](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556.pdf) and [Image-Net](http://www.image-net.org/) as a data set for traininig.


If you want to know more about VGG-16, check [this page](https://neurohive.io/en/popular-networks/vgg16/).

### Implementation

For the implementation we will use Python3 and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).


### Environment

We use [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) to run the code and observe the results.


### Code

All code is available on the [Github](https://github.com/kurbakov/dog-bread-classification)
