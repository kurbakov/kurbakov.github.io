### About

Trajectory planning is one of the most chelleging areas in robotics and autonomous driving. In this project we cover [SLAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping) and see how you can use [Turtle Bot](https://www.turtlebot.com/) in [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/).


### Implementation

For the implementation we will use navigation ROS stack: [acml](http://wiki.ros.org/amcl), [move_base](http://wiki.ros.org/move_base), and some other. We also will use [GMapping](http://wiki.ros.org/gmapping). 


### Envorinment

To implemet and verify we use [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/). It is a free tool for robot simulation.


### Code

All code is available on the [Github](https://github.com/kurbakov/robot-trajectory-planning)
