### Paper

[Facial Key Points Detection using Deep Convolutional Neural Network - NaimishNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.00977.pdf)

Important: the project does not implement the paper, but uses the paper to answer some questions. Paper is just as a reference for better understanding.

### About

Convolutional network networks is a very powerful tool. We use CNN to detect lips, eyes, nose in form of the points on the image.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network)

> In deep learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN, or ConvNet) is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery. ... They have applications in image and video recognition, recommender systems, image classification, medical image analysis, natural language processing, brain-computer interfaces, and financial time series.


### Implementation

For the implementation we will use Python3 and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).


### Environment

We use [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) to run the code and observe the results.


### Code

All code is available on the [Github](https://github.com/kurbakov/facial-keypoints)
